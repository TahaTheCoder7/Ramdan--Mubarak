  <!-- Main Content -->
  <p>
    Taraweeh prayers are a significant part of the spiritual practices during the month of Ramadan. These are voluntary prayers that are performed after the Isha (night) prayer, specifically during the blessed month of Ramadan.
    <br><br>

    1. <strong>What is Taraweeh?</strong><br>
    Taraweeh prayers are voluntary prayers, and they are performed in addition to the five daily obligatory prayers. It is a tradition of Prophet Muhammad (ï·º) to offer these prayers in the night during Ramadan. 
    Taraweeh is an Arabic word that means "rest" because worshippers take short breaks after every four Rak'ahs.<br><br>

    2. <strong>Number of Rak'ahs</strong><br>
    Taraweeh consists of 8 or 20 Rak'ahs (units of prayer), depending on the practice followed in different regions. In some places, 8 Rak'ahs are performed, while in others, 20 are prayed.<br><br>

    3. <strong>Spiritual Benefits of Taraweeh</strong><br>
    Taraweeh is a source of immense blessings. During these prayers, the Qurâ€™an is recited in its entirety over the course of the month. This provides an opportunity for worshippers to reflect on the meanings of the Qur'an and to develop a stronger connection with Allah.<br>
    It is said that praying Taraweeh in Ramadan leads to forgiveness of sins and greater rewards.<br><br>

    4. <strong>How to Perform Taraweeh</strong><br>
    Taraweeh can be performed alone or in congregation, and the number of Rak'ahs can vary according to tradition. Generally, after performing Isha prayer, worshippers offer 2-4 Rak'ahs of Taraweeh at a time, taking short breaks between sets of four.<br><br>

    5. <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
    Taraweeh is a beautiful act of worship that holds great significance in the blessed month of Ramadan. It serves as a spiritual practice to seek closeness to Allah and to strengthen oneâ€™s faith. Praying Taraweeh is an opportunity to earn Allahâ€™s mercy and forgiveness during Ramadan.<br><br>

    May Allah accept our prayers and grant us success in this blessed month! ðŸ¤²âœ¨
