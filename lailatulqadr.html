    Lailat-ul-Qadr, also known as the Night of Decree or Night of Power, is one of the most significant nights of the Islamic calendar. It is a night when the Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (ï·º), and it falls within the last ten nights of Ramadan.<br><br>
    1. <strong>When is Lailat-ul-Qadr?</strong><br>
    Lailat-ul-Qadr falls on one of the odd-numbered nights during the last ten days of Ramadan, with the 27th night being the most widely observed. However, the exact night is not known, which encourages Muslims to seek it throughout the last ten nights.<br><br>
    2. <strong>The Importance of Lailat-ul-Qadr</strong><br>
    Lailat-ul-Qadr is the night when the Qur'an was revealed, and it holds immense spiritual significance. Allah says in the Qur'an:<br>
    "Indeed, We sent it [the Qur'an] down during the Night of Decree. And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months." (Surah Al-Qadr 97:1-3)<br><br>
    3. <strong>Spiritual Significance of Lailat-ul-Qadr</strong><br>
    It is the night when Allahâ€™s mercy is abundant, and He forgives the sins of those who sincerely repent. This night is an opportunity to seek forgiveness and ask for Allah's blessings. Prayers offered during this night are considered more valuable than those offered during a thousand months.<br><br>
    4. <strong>How to Worship on Lailat-ul-Qadr</strong><br>
    Muslims engage in extra prayers (Taraweeh), recite the Qur'an, make Dua (supplications), and ask for Allahâ€™s forgiveness. It is a night of deep reflection, gratitude, and prayer.<br><br>
    5. <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
    The Night of Lailat-ul-Qadr is a precious opportunity for Muslims to connect with Allah, seek His forgiveness, and increase their worship. It is a time to reflect on the mercy of Allah and strive to better ourselves spiritually.<br><br>
    May Allah grant us the ability to witness this blessed night and accept our worship! ðŸ¤²âœ¨
